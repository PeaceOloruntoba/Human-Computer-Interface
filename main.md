CMP 424 - Human-Computer Interface

HCI was previously known as man-machine interaction, it deals with the design execution of computer systems and assessments related to phenomena for human use. It can be used in non-disciple wherever there is computer installation.



Guidelines. in HCI

Ben Schneider Man’s 8 golden rules: an American computer scientist consolidated some implicit facts about designing and came up with some guidelines. that is beneficial for normal design and interface designers. With these guidelines it is possible to differentiate a good interface design from a bad one the guidelines include:
Strive for consistency
Cater to universal usability
Offer informative feedback
Design dialogue to yield closure
Preventive errors
Permit easy reversal of actions
Support internal locals of control
Reduce short-time memory load 


Normal’s: he proposes 7 principles that can be used to transform 7 difficult tasks to assess the interaction between humans and computers and the principle are as follows:
Use both knowledges in words and knowledge in the head
Simplify task structure too
Make things visible
Get the mapping right (user meta model = conceptual model = design model)
Convert Constraints into advantages
Design for error
When all else fails


Nielsen’s Principles: this serves as a checklist for evaluating and explaining problems for heuristic evaluators while auditing an interface or a product. Principles include:
Visibility of system status
Match between systems and real-world
User control and freedom
Consistency and standard
Error Prevention
Recognition rather than recall
Flexibility and efficiency of use
Aesthetic and minimalist design
Diagnosis and recovery from error
Documentation and help

The interactive system design

The conceptual usability engineering. This is a method in the progress of software and systems, which includes user contribution from the exception of the process and assures the effectiveness of the product through the use of usability requirements and metrics. The usability function features of the entire process of abstracting, implementing, and testing hardware and software products, while the requirement gathering stage to installations, marketing, and testing of the product falls in this process.



Goals of Usability in Engineering

Effective to use I.e functional
Efficient to use i.e. efficient
Error-free in use i.e. safe
Easy to use I.e. friendly
Enjoyable in use I.e. delightful experience


Relationship between the HCI and Software Engineering

Waterfall Model

It’s a type of model whereby software developers follow a well define engineering procedures in the development of software products. This consists of several phases which are processed in a linear fashion. It is similar to build and fixed models but in this case, the entire product is built and delivered to the client. The client prompts out what is to be changed and the developer affects the change to the satisfaction of the client which is why it is considered as a build and fixed model.



Advantages of the waterfall model

It enforces a discipline engineering approach
It is easy to manage because verification and review are done after each phase
Documentation can reduce maintainers’ costs because documentation is produced at every stage.
Feedback loops help to correct faults immediately
The Model is simple easy to understand and use


Disadvantages of the waterfall model

It lacks flexibility
It generates few visible signs of progress until the very end
It is not a good model for complex and object-oriented models
A high amount of risk and uncertainty because the customer only sees the working version and this may result in disaster if any undetected problem is perceived at this stage.
